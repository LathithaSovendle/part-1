    <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p >Helping Hands Foundation began its journey in Johannesburg in 2019,when a small group of passionate volunteers<br>
             noticed the growing number of children living and begging on the streets. <br>
            Their warty work was simple but hearthest offering warm meals,clean cinthing, and kind conversations to children who often went unnoticed.<br>
             As the reach grew,so did their commitment.<br>In 2021, they officially registered as a non-profit organization to expand their efforts and gain more community support.<br>
            Today, Helping Hands partners with schools, clinics,and other local organizations to run regular feeding programs,<br>
            provide basic beatth check-ups, and reller children to safe housing facilities. Over the years, their work hes become well known<br>
